## 🐤 Why "Pollito"?

"Pollito" (Spanish for *little chicken*) has been my nickname since my very first birthday, when I was dressed head-to-toe in bright yellow. It stuck—and eventually became part of my professional identity. The 🐤 brand reflects my belief that serious work can still carry personality and warmth.

> _The sheer volume of technologies, frameworks, and concepts in software development is overwhelming. It is impossible to know everything. Accept this sooner rather than later. Trying to master every new trend is a recipe for burnout. Once you accept this, you can focus. It's okay to say "I don't know, but I can find out"._
